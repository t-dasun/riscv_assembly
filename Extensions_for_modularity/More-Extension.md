# Other RISC-V Extensions & The Ratification Process

The open-source nature of RISC-V encourages the development of numerous specialized extensions beyond the standard ones. This document provides a brief overview of some notable examples and the official process for an extension to be adopted. ðŸ“œ

## Notable RISC-V Extensions

While this course doesn't cover them in detail, here are some other important extensions:
* **'Q' Extension**: For **q**uad-precision (128-bit) floating-point operations.
* **'B' Extension**: For advanced **b**it manipulation operations.
* **'S' Extension**: Defines instructions for **s**upervisor-level operating modes.
* **'H' Extension**: Defines instructions for **h**ypervisor support, used in virtualization.
* **'L' Extension**: For decima**l** floating-point operations.
* **'P' Extension**: For **P**acked-SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, which process multiple small data items in parallel.
* **'V' Extension**: For advanced **v**ector processing, a more powerful and flexible approach to SIMD.

**Status Note:** As of the information provided, the **Q, B, S, and H** extensions are **ratified** (official and finalized), while others like L, P, and V are still in development or under review.

## The Extension Ratification Process

The RISC-V Foundation has a formal procedure to ensure that extensions are well-designed, stable, and have community support before becoming an official part of the ISA. The process has three main stages:



1.  **Open Status**
    This is the initial development phase. The extension is actively being designed and debated by its proponents and the wider RISC-V community. Features can change significantly during this stage.

2.  **Frozen Status**
    An extension becomes "frozen" when its core features are considered complete and stable. At this point, only minor updates are expected. The extension is then opened for a period of public review for final refinement and feedback.

3.  **Ratified Status** âœ…
    After the public review period, a frozen extension is put to a formal vote by the RISC-V Technical Steering Committee (TSC). If the vote passes, the extension is officially **ratified**, making it a final, stable part of the RISC-V ISA.
