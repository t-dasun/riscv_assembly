# RISC-V 'F' Standard Extension: Single-Precision Floating-Point

The 'F' extension provides RISC-V with instructions and registers for **single-precision floating-point** arithmetic, adhering to the IEEE 754-2008 standard. üìê

## Floating-Point Architecture

### Register File
* The 'F' extension introduces a **separate register file** for floating-point values, named `f0` through `f31`.
    * Register File: This is a hardware term. It describes the physical structure‚Äîan indexed array of registers bundled together. same as int general perpose regs x0-x31.
* This keeps floating-point operations separate from integer operations, which can simplify the CPU hardware design (e.g., by allowing a decoupled Floating-Point Unit (FPU)).
    * A Floating-Point Unit (FPU) is a specialized part of a processor designed specifically to handle calculations with floating-point numbers.
* The width of these registers is called **FLEN**, which is 32 bits for the 'F' extension.

### Control and Status Register (`fcsr`)
* A new Control and Status Register (CSR) call `fcsr`, is added to manage the FPU.
* It holds the current **rounding mode** and any **exception flags** (like overflow, underflow, or divide by zero).
* Accessing this register requires the "Zicsr" extension.

## Instructions

The 'F' extension adds instructions for moving data, arithmetic, and comparisons.

### Load and Store
These instructions move 32-bit single-precision float values between memory and the floating-point register file.
* **`FLW rd, rs1, offset`** (Float Load Word): Loads a word from memory into float register `rd`. (I type)
* **`FSW rd, rs1, offset`** (Float Store Word): Stores a word from float register `rd` into memory. (S type)

### Arithmetic Operations
These instructions perform standard floating-point calculations. They all use the R-type format.
* **`FADD rd, rs1, rs2`**: `rd ‚Üê rs1 + rs2`
* **`FSUB rd, rs1, rs2`**: `rd ‚Üê rs1 - rs2`
* **`FMUL rd, rs1, rs2`**: `rd ‚Üê rs1 √ó rs2`
* **`FDIV rd, rs1, rs2`**: `rd ‚Üê rs1 / rs2`
* **`FSQRT rd, rs`**: `rd ‚Üê ‚àörs` (Note: `FSQRT` only uses one source register).

### Comparison Operations
These instructions compare two floating-point values. (R-type format)
* **`FMIN rd, rs1, rs2`**: Stores the smaller of the two source values into `rd`.
* **`FMAX rd, rs1, rs2`**: Stores the larger of the two source values into `rd`.

# RISC-V 'F' Extension: Additional Instructions

This document covers the advanced arithmetic, conversion, and utility instructions in the single-precision floating-point ('F') extension.

## Fused Multiply-Add Instructions

These instructions perform a multiplication and an addition/subtraction in a single, fused operation. This is faster and more precise than two separate instructions because the intermediate product is not rounded. They use a special R4-type format to accommodate three source registers.

* **`FMADD.S rd, rs1, rs2, rs3`**: `rd ‚Üê (rs1 √ó rs2) + rs3` (float multiply-add)
* **`FMSUB.S rd, rs1, rs2, rs3`**: `rd ‚Üê (rs1 √ó rs2) - rs3`
* **`FNMADD.S rd, rs1, rs2, rs3`**: `rd ‚Üê -(rs1 √ó rs2) + rs3` (Negated Multiply-Add)
* **`FNMSUB.S rd, rs1, rs2, rs3`**: `rd ‚Üê -(rs1 √ó rs2) - rs3` (Negated Multiply-Subtract)

---

## Sign-Injection Instructions

These instructions create a new floating-point number in `rd` by combining the magnitude of `rs1` with a sign bit derived from `rs1` and `rs2`. (R-type)

* **`FSGNJ.S rd, rs1, rs2`**: "Sign-Inject" - Sets `rd` to the value of `rs1` with the sign of `rs2`.
* **`FSGNJN.S rd, rs1, rs2`**: "Sign-Inject-Negate" - Sets `rd` to the value of `rs1` with the *inverted* sign of `rs2`.
* **`FSGNJX.S rd, rs1, rs2`**: "Sign-Inject-XOR" - Sets `rd` to the value of `rs1` with a sign that is the XOR of the signs of `rs1` and `rs2`.

## Conversion Instructions

These instructions convert values between floating-point and integer formats.(R-type)

### Float-to-Integer (`FCVT.int.S`)
* **`FCVT.W.S rd, rs1`**: Converts float in `rs1` to a 32-bit **signed** integer in `rd`.

## Integer and Floating-Point Move Instructions

These instructions move the raw 32-bit pattern between the integer and floating-point register files **without any conversion or modification**.(R-type)

## Comparison and Classification

### Comparison Instructions
These instructions compare two float registers (`rs1`, `rs2`) and write a boolean result (`1` for true, `0` for false) to an **integer** register `rd`.(R-type)
