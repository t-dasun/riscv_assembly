# RISC-V 'Zicsr' and 'Zifencei' Extensions

## 'Zicsr': Control and Status Register Instructions ðŸ“œ
This extension provides the standard instructions needed to read and write the Control and Status Registers (CSRs), which are used to configure and monitor the processor's state.

### Register-Based CSR Instructions
These instructions use a general-purpose register (`rs1`) as a data source.

* **`CSRRW rd, csr, rs1`** (CSR Read and Write): Atomically swaps values. The original value of the `csr` is written to `rd`, and the value from `rs1` is written to the `csr`.
* **`CSRRS rd, csr, rs1`** (CSR Read and Set): Reads the `csr` value into `rd`, then sets bits in the `csr`. The value in `rs1` acts as a bitmask; for each `1` in `rs1`, the corresponding bit in the `csr` is set to `1`.
* **`CSRRC rd, csr, rs1`** (CSR Read and Clear): Reads the `csr` value into `rd`, then clears bits in the `csr`. The value in `rs1` acts as a bitmask; for each `1` in `rs1`, the corresponding bit in the `csr` is cleared to `0`.

### Immediate-Based CSR Instructions
These instructions are similar but use a 5-bit immediate value (zero-extended to `XLEN`) instead of a register.

* **`CSRRWI rd, csr, imm`**: Reads the `csr` into `rd` and writes the immediate value to the `csr`.
* **`CSRRSI rd, csr, imm`**: Reads the `csr` into `rd` and uses the immediate as a bitmask to **set** bits.
* **`CSRRCI rd, csr, imm`**: Reads the `csr` into `rd` and uses the immediate as a bitmask to **clear** bits.

### Pseudo-instructions
These are common operations provided by assemblers for convenience. They are implemented by using the `x0` (zero) register to ignore a read or a write.

* **`CSRR rd, csr`** (CSR Read): Reads the value of `csr` into `rd`. Expands to `CSRRS rd, csr, x0`.
* **`CSRW csr, rs1`** (CSR Write): Writes the value of `rs1` into `csr`. Expands to `CSRRW x0, csr, rs1`.
* **`CSRS csr, rs1`** (CSR Set): Sets bits in `csr` using `rs1` as a mask. Expands to `CSRRS x0, csr, rs1`.
* **`CSRC csr, rs1`** (CSR Clear): Clears bits in `csr` using `rs1` as a mask. Expands to `CSRRC x0, csr, rs1`.
* **`CSRSI csr, imm`** (CSR Set Immediate): Sets bits in `csr` using an immediate. Expands to `CSRRSI x0, csr, imm`.
* **`CSRCI csr, imm`** (CSR Clear Immediate): Clears bits in `csr` using an immediate. Expands to `CSRRCI x0, csr, imm`.

**Note:** Most CSR write operations are **privileged** and can only be executed in higher-privilege modes (like machine mode).

## 'Zifencei': Instruction-Fetch Fence ðŸš§
This small extension adds a single, important instruction for synchronization.

### The `FENCE.I` Instruction
* **Syntax**: `FENCE.I`
* **Purpose**: To synchronize the instruction and data streams.
* **Function**: It acts as a memory barrier that ensures all data stores completed **before** the `FENCE.I` are visible to the instruction fetch unit **after** the `FENCE.I`.
* **Use Case**: This is critical for systems that modify their own code, such as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers or self-updating programs. It guarantees that the processor fetches the newly written instructions, not the old, stale ones.

This is different from the standard `FENCE` instruction, which synchronizes **data memory** accesses between different harts. `FENCE.I` synchronizes writes to instruction memory with the processor's own instruction fetch logic.
